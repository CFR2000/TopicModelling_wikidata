## UE 803: Data Science
# Project: Clustering and Classifying Articles based on Text and knowledge-base information

## About this project
In this project, we need to collect information about articles belonging to different categories (such as airports, artists, politicians, sportspeople, etc). Based on this information, we will try to automatically cluster and classify these articles into the correct categories. The source of information we are using are:
* Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia
* Wikidata knowledge base

## Installation
Note: Following code has been implemented in Python3

1. cd to the directory where ```requirements.txt``` is located;

2. run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` .

## General Overview
The project constitues of four steps, namely:
1. Corpus Extraction
2. Pre-Processing
3. Clustering
4. Classifying

### Corpus Extraction

### Pre-Processing

### Clustering

### Classifying


# Classification

**```classification.py```** script  takes file path as input , preprocesses using Tf-Idf Vectorizer and train a single layer perceptron model to predict classes. The evaluation results are as follows 

- ```Confusion matrix 16 classes.png``` with the confusion matrix for the 16 class classification


- ```Scores 16 classes.csv``` with the Recall, Precision and F-score computed for the 16 class classification


## Results

The results are obtained on the data stored in the ```data``` directory:

**Classification**:

**16 class classification:**
